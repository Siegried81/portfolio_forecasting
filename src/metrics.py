"""
Core financial time-series metrics: returns, risk, and risk-adjusted performance.

Pure functions only (no Streamlit, no I/O) - this is intentional: it's the module
most likely to be unit-tested (see tests/test_metrics.py) and reused outside the
app (a notebook, a batch job), so it must not depend on the UI layer.

Conventions used throughout:
- Returns are simple (arithmetic) period returns, i.e. p(t)/p(t-1) - 1, NOT log
  returns. Simple returns are additive across assets (needed for portfolio-level
  aggregation via weights) but NOT across time; log returns are the reverse. Since
  every metric here is portfolio-level first, time-aggregated second, simple
  returns are the correct choice and we compound them explicitly where needed.
- "Annualised" always means scaled by `periods_per_year`, passed in explicitly
  rather than hardcoded, because the app supports daily/weekly/monthly frequencies.
