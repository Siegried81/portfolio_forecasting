"""
Time-series diagnostics: stationarity, trend persistence, and rolling
risk-adjusted return — added 2026-09-04, kept in their own module rather than
folded into metrics.py because they answer a different question. metrics.py
summarises PERFORMANCE (a single number per return series); this module
diagnoses the series' own STRUCTURE (is it stationary? trending or
mean-reverting? how does risk-adjusted return evolve over time?) — the kind
of question an economist/quant asks before trusting a forecast, not after.

Two of the three functions here directly validate assumptions made elsewhere
in this codebase rather than adding a disconnected number: the ADF test
checks forecasting.py's own d=1 first-differencing assumption instead of just
asserting it, and the Hurst exponent gives a concrete, per-asset answer to
the efficient-market-hypothesis caveat already stated throughout the app
("short-horizon price forecasts carry weak predictive power") — a Hurst near
0.5 is the quantitative confirmation of exactly that caveat, per asset.

    Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, run on RETURNS (not prices) — the null
    hypothesis is that the series has a unit root (is non-stationary).
    Directly validates forecasting.py's own ARIMA `d=1` choice: ARIMA fixes
    first-differencing because price LEVELS are non-stationary by
    construction, and this test checks whether the differenced series (i.e.
    returns) actually IS stationary, rather than the codebase just asserting
    it.

    Hurst exponent via the variance-of-lagged-differences method: a standard,

    deviation of lagged price differences against the lag, slope × 2 = H) —
    not full rescaled-range (R/S) analysis, which is more robust but a
    meaningfully bigger implementation. Documented as a simplification
    deliberately, same spirit as other documented trade-offs in this codebase
    (e.g. TF-IDF vs neural embeddings in rag.py).

    by a move in the same direction); H < 0.5 = mean-reverting (a move tends
    to reverse); H ≈ 0.5 = a random walk — the quantitative, per-asset version
    of the efficient-market-hypothesis caveat already stated throughout this
    app's forecasting UI. Computed on PRICES (not returns) since it measures
    the persistence of the level series itself, the standard convention.
