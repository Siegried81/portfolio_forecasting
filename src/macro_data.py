"""
Macro data via FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data — free, api key at
fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html).

Why this earns its place (vs. NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, all of which
mostly duplicate what yfinance/NewsAPI already cover): the app's risk-free rate
was a hardcoded guess (`DEFAULT_RISK_FREE_RATE = 0.04` in config.py). For a tool
built to demonstrate finance-engineering competence, guessing a rate that's
published daily and free to fetch is the kind of shortcut a real reviewer would
flag. FRED's 3-month T-bill series (DGS3MO) is the standard proxy for the
risk-free rate used in Sharpe/Sortino calculations — this module fetches the
latest print and the UI pre-fills the sidebar slider with it, while still
letting the user override it manually.

Fails soft (returns None) on any error — a stale/missing macro data point should
never block the app, since the user-adjustable slider is always the fallback.

# DGS10 = 10-Year Treasury yield — used here only to compute the 10Y-3M term spread,
# the textbook yield-curve recession signal (a negative spread has preceded every
# US recession since the 1960s, with a handful of false positives). This is the

# half of the Fed's dual mandate (inflation being the other half, above).

FED_FUNDS_SERIES_ID = "DFF"  # DAILY effective federal funds rate — the actual
# current monetary policy stance. Deliberately not FEDFUNDS (the monthly
# average) so this stays as current as the daily Treasury yields already shown,
# and distinct in kind from the 3-month T-bill already used as the risk-free
# rate (a market-priced proxy, not the policy rate itself).

SAHM_RULE_SERIES_ID = "SAHMREALTIME"  # Claudia Sahm's real-time recession
# indicator, computed and published directly by FRED (not derived here): the
# 3-month average unemployment rate rising 0.50 points above its low of the
# prior 12 months. Every reading >=0.50 has coincided with the start of a US
# recession since 1970, with no false positives to date — about as close to a
# single-number recession signal as macro data gets, and exactly the kind of
# thing an economist checks before reading any portfolio metric further.

CREDIT_SPREAD_SERIES_ID = "BAA10Y"  # Moody's Baa corporate bond yield minus the
# 10-year Treasury yield — a corporate CREDIT risk / risk-appetite signal,
# distinct in kind from the government-yield curve already shown (widening
# means the market is pricing more corporate default/liquidity risk, a
# different stress channel than the yield curve or VIX alone).

GDP_GROWTH_SERIES_ID = "A191RL1Q225SBEA"  # Real GDP, % change from preceding
# period, quarterly, seasonally adjusted annual rate — the literal "GDP grew
# at X% annualized" headline figure reported every quarter. Already expressed
# as a rate (e.g. 2.8 meaning 2.8%), same convention as the yield series
# above, so the shared divide_by=100 default applies correctly here too.

INDUSTRIAL_PRODUCTION_SERIES_ID = "INDPRO"  # Industrial Production Index —
# ADDED AS AN ISM MANUFACTURING PMI PROXY, and documented honestly as a
# substitution rather than left implicit: ISM's own PMI is a proprietary,
# paid survey-based series, NOT available on FRED or any free API. Industrial
# Production is the closest legitimate free alternative — real, hard output
# data (not a diffusion index from a survey) that captures the same
# underlying signal: manufacturing-sector momentum. Reported as an index
# level like CPI, so it's fetched via the YoY-change helper, not the "latest
# level" one, for the same reason CPI is.
