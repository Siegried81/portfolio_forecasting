"""
PCA-based statistical factor model for covariance estimation — added 2026-09-04
as the tractable alternative to Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage once the investable
universe gets wide relative to the history available.

Why this exists (the actual math, not just "big universes are hard"): with N
assets, a covariance matrix has N(N+1)/2 free parameters to estimate. For
N=500 that's 125,250 parameters against, at best, a few thousand daily
observations — badly underdetermined, and Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage (already used
elsewhere in this app) only partially compensates; it doesn't fix the
underlying degrees-of-freedom problem. A factor model does: assume returns are
driven by a SMALL number of common factors plus asset-specific noise, and the
parameter count collapses from N(N+1)/2 down to roughly N × k (k = number of
factors) + N (idiosyncratic variances) — tractable even for hundreds of names.

This is a STATISTICAL factor model: PCA extracts the factors directly from
the return data's own covariance structure (orthogonal by construction), as
opposed to a FUNDAMENTAL factor model like Barra or Fama-French, which uses
PRE-SPECIFIED style factors (value, size, momentum, ...) fit by cross-
sectional regression against known company characteristics. Documented here
honestly as the lighter, statistical version of the same core idea real
buy-side desks use for exactly this problem — not a claim that this
reproduces Barra's actual factor set, which this project has neither the data
(fundamentals for hundreds of names) nor the scope to build.

    """
    Estimate an annualised covariance matrix via a PCA statistical factor
    model instead of the sample/shrinkage covariance used elsewhere.

    Method: demean returns, extract the top `n_factors` principal components
    (orthogonal by construction, so their covariance is diagonal), build the
    SYSTEMATIC covariance from asset loadings on those factors
    (`loadings @ diag(factor_variances) @ loadings.T`), then add a diagonal
    IDIOSYNCRATIC term — whatever variance each asset's own sample variance
    has left over after the systematic part is accounted for. That diagonal-
    only idiosyncratic assumption (residual risk uncorrelated ACROSS assets)
    is the standard orthogonal-factor-model simplification, and it's exactly
    what collapses the parameter count.

    `n_factors` is clamped to `[MIN_PCA_FACTORS, min(MAX_PCA_FACTORS,
    n_assets - 1, n_observations - 1)]` — silently, but the returned
    diagnostics report the actual count used so a caller/UI can surface it
    rather than the request being silently different from the result.

    Returns (covariance_df, diagnostics). `diagnostics` contains:
      - "n_factors_used": the actual (possibly clamped) factor count
      - "explained_variance_ratio": list, per factor, of the return
        variance it explains
      - "cumulative_explained": total variance explained by all factors used
        — the number that actually matters for judging whether this
        covariance estimate is trustworthy. A factor model explaining 35% of
        variance is a materially weaker estimate than one explaining 85%,
        and burying that in a list of ten small numbers isn't the same as
        surfacing it.

    Raises ValueError if there isn't enough data to fit even one factor
    (fewer than 2 assets or fewer than 2 observations) — this is a real
    input-validation failure the caller should see, not silently degrade.
