"""
Mean-variance portfolio optimization via PyPortfolioOpt (chosen over Riskfolio-Lib:
lighter footprint, actively maintained, and covers exactly what the brief needs —
max-Sharpe / min-vol optimal weights + an efficient frontier — without the extra
install weight of Riskfolio-Lib's convex-optimization stack).

This module is deliberately agnostic to WHERE mu (expected returns) and the
covariance matrix come from — the same `optimize_max_sharpe` / `efficient_frontier_points`
functions are used for all three portfolios the brief asks for:
  1. Historical-based  : mu/cov estimated from realised historical returns
  2. Forecast-based    : mu from the forecasting module, cov still historical
                          (covariance forecasting is a research problem in itself;
                          using the historical covariance is standard practice
                          even in forecast-driven allocation)
  3. Realized-optimal  : mu/cov estimated from the ACTUAL future returns (hindsight
                          optimum) — the benchmark the other two are judged against

    Annualised mean historical return (mu) and covariance from a price
    history. `cov_method` selects between two genuinely different covariance
    ESTIMATORS — mu is always the same historical mean either way:

    - `"ledoit_wolf"` (default): shrinkage covariance, the long-standing
      approach here. With few assets and a short history the raw sample
      covariance is noisy and can produce unstable, extreme optimal weights
      — shrinkage is the standard practitioner fix (Ledoit & Wolf, 2004).
    - `"pca"`: a statistical factor-model covariance (see
      `factor_models.pca_factor_cov`) — the tractable alternative once the
      universe gets wide relative to the history available (see that
      module's docstring and README's "Why not all 500 S&P constituents").

    Single dispatch point, kept here rather than scattered across call
    sites, so every caller (frontier, single-window comparison, walk-forward)
    picks up the same estimator from one config choice — this module's own
    stated design goal of staying agnostic to WHERE mu/cov come from.

    `periods_per_year` MUST match the actual periodicity of `prices` (252 for
    daily, 52 for weekly, 12 for monthly — see config.FREQUENCY_TO_PERIODS_PER_YEAR).
    Passing the wrong value here doesn't error — it just silently annualises
    as if every row were one trading day, which massively overstates
    "expected return" on weekly/monthly data (a ~5-year weekly series has ~260
    rows; annualising with frequency=252 treats that as barely one year of daily
    data, compounding the horizon by roughly 5x). Always pass the caller's actual
    `periods_per_year`, never rely on the default.
